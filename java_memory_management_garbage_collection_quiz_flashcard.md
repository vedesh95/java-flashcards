## üåü Answers

1Ô∏è‚É£ Heap (objects), stack (frames, locals), method area/metaspace (class data), PC register (current instruction), native method stack (native calls).

2Ô∏è‚É£ The heap stores all objects and instance variables and is managed by the GC.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The stack stores method calls, local variables, and references to heap objects.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The method area/metaspace holds class metadata, static variables, and method code.

5Ô∏è‚É£ The PC register holds the address of the currently executing instruction for the thread.

6Ô∏è‚É£ The native method stack handles native (non-Java) method invocations.

7Ô∏è‚É£ A strong reference prevents the GC from collecting the object.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Soft references are cleared only when the JVM needs memory.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Weak references are cleared at the next GC cycle if no strong references exist.

üîü Phantom references are used to schedule actions after finalization but before memory is reclaimed.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ The heap is shared between threads; stacks, PC registers, and native method stacks are thread-specific.

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Marks reachable objects, sweeps unmarked objects to reclaim memory.

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Mark-and-compact also moves live objects together, eliminating fragmentation.

1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Copies live objects from one region (from-space) to another (to-space), leaving dead objects behind.

1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ It optimizes collection by treating short-lived and long-lived objects differently.

1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Suitable for single-CPU machines or small heaps; simple stop-the-world behavior.

1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Uses multiple threads to speed up collection and improve throughput.

1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ G1 GC breaks the heap into regions and prioritizes regions with most garbage for collection.

1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ They provide low-latency GC by performing most work concurrently with application threads.
