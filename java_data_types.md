# Java Data Types Flashcard

---

## üåü Summary / Overview

Java provides two broad categories of data types: **primitive types** and **reference types**.

### Primitive Data Types

| Type    | Size (bits)   | Range / Notes                    |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| byte    | 8             | -128 to 127                      |
| short   | 16            | -32,768 to 32,767                |
| int     | 32            | -2^31 to 2^31-1                  |
| long    | 64            | -2^63 to 2^63-1                  |
| float   | 32            | \~6-7 decimal digits precision   |
| double  | 64            | \~15 decimal digits precision    |
| char    | 16            | Unicode characters (0 to 65,535) |
| boolean | JVM dependent | true / false                     |

### Reference Data Types (Detailed)

Reference types store **memory addresses (references)** to actual objects, not the object‚Äôs data directly. The types that fall under reference types include:

- **Classes**: Any instance of a class (e.g., `String`, `Scanner`, `ArrayList`).
- **Interfaces**: Variables declared as an interface type can reference objects of classes implementing that interface.
- **Arrays**: Arrays of primitive or reference types are themselves objects.
- **Enums**: Special reference types that define a set of constants.

#### Key points about reference types:

- The value stored in the variable is the address pointing to the object in memory.
- Access to the actual data is done through this reference.
- When you assign one reference variable to another, both point to the same object.
- The default value for reference types is `null`.
- `null` means the reference does not point to any object.

### Autoboxing and Unboxing

- **Autoboxing**: Automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class (e.g., `int` ‚Üí `Integer`).
- **Unboxing**: Automatic conversion of a wrapper class object back to its corresponding primitive type.
- These conversions happen implicitly, for example:

```java
Integer obj = 5;  // autoboxing of int 5 to Integer
int num = obj;    // unboxing Integer to int
```

### String Pool

- The **String pool** (or intern pool) is a special memory region where Java stores string literals.
- If two string literals have the same content, they share the same object in the pool.
- Example:

```java
String a = "hello";
String b = "hello";
System.out.println(a == b); // true, same pool object
```

- Using `new String("hello")` creates a new object outside the pool.

## üåü Answers

1Ô∏è‚É£ Java's primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Reference data types include classes, interfaces, arrays, and enums.

3Ô∏è‚É£ A reference variable stores the memory address of the object it refers to.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The default value of a reference type is `null`.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Arrays are treated as objects and are reference types in Java.

6Ô∏è‚É£ If two reference variables point to the same object, changes made via one reference are visible through the other.

7Ô∏è‚É£ `null` indicates that a reference variable does not point to any object in memory.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of a primitive type to its wrapper class. Unboxing is the reverse: wrapper to primitive.

9Ô∏è‚É£ The String pool is a memory region that stores string literals so identical literals share the same object, saving memory.

üîü Using `new String()` creates a new string object on the heap, not the pool, even if the content is identical to an existing string literal.
