Java JDK, JRE, JVM Flashcard

üåü Summary / Overview

Java development and runtime environments consist of three major components that work together:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

The JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode.

It provides platform independence by interpreting or compiling (via JIT) bytecode to native machine code.

Handles memory management (heap, stack), garbage collection, and security.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

The JRE is what you need to run Java programs.

Contains the JVM + standard class libraries + supporting files.

Does not include development tools like javac.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Java Development Kit (JDK)

The JDK is for developing Java applications.

Contains JRE + development tools (e.g., javac, javadoc, debugger).

JIT Compiler

The Just-In-Time compiler is part of the JVM (inside JRE).

Converts frequently used bytecode into native machine code at runtime for better performance.

3Ô∏è‚É£ How is the JDK different from the JRE?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Where does the JIT compiler fit in the Java architecture?

5Ô∏è‚É£ Can you run a Java program with just the JDK?

6Ô∏è‚É£ What does the JVM provide to ensure platform independence?

üåü Answers

1Ô∏è‚É£ The JVM runs Java bytecode, handles memory, and manages runtime execution.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The JRE includes the JVM, standard class libraries, and supporting files needed to run Java apps.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The JDK contains the JRE plus development tools like compilers and debuggers.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The JIT compiler is part of the JVM's execution engine, translating bytecode to native code at runtime.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Yes ‚Äî the JDK includes the JRE, so you can both compile and run Java programs.

6Ô∏è‚É£ The JVM interprets or compiles bytecode into native instructions, allowing the same bytecode to run on any platform with a JVM.
